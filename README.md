## ‚ú® Features

- ‚úÖ URL Signing & Verification
- ‚úÖ Signature Expiration Validation
- ‚úÖ Support for Encrypting/Decrypting the `file` Parameter
- ‚úÖ Auto-Generated Key Configuration (on Installation)
- ‚úÖ No Dependency on Redis, Databases, or Other Services

---

## üì¶ Installation

Install via Composer:

```bash
composer require hejunjie/url-signer
```

A key configuration file will be automatically generated after installation: `config/urlsigner.php`„ÄÇ

The default configuration file path is `config/urlsigner.php`, with the following structure:

```php
<?php

return [
    'secretKey' => 'xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx', // 32-character length string
    'default_expire' => 3600, // Default expiration time (in seconds)
];
```

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Generate Signed URL

```php
use Hejunjie\UrlSigner\UrlSigner;

$signer = new UrlSigner();
$signedUrl = $signer->sign('https://yourdomain.com/download', [
    'file' => 'path/to/secret.pdf'
]);

echo $signedUrl;
// https://yourdomain.com/download?file=EncryptedContent&_t=Timestamp&_e=ExpirationTime&_sign=Signature
```

### Validate Signed Request

```php
use Hejunjie\UrlSigner\UrlSigner;

$signer = new UrlSigner();

if (!$signer->validate($_GET)) {
    http_response_code(403);
    exit('Invalid request or the link has expired');
}

$file = $signer->decryptParam($_GET['file']);
// Continue processing the file download logic
```

## üß† Usage Example ‚Äì Generate a Download Link

Using Webman as an example

1. Create a method for downloading a file:
    ```php
    <?php

    namespace app\controller;

    use support\Request;
    use support\Response;
    use Hejunjie\UrlSigner\UrlSigner;

    class DownloadController
    {

        /**
         * Generic Method for File Download
         * 
         * @param string $path File Path to Download
         * @method GET
         * 
         * @return Response
         */
        public function download(Request $request): Response
        {
            // Get all request parameters
            $param = $request->all();
            // Validate the signature validity
            $urlSigner = new UrlSigner();
            // If a custom `secretKey` is used, it can be passed as configuration when instantiating the class
            // $sign = new UrlSigner([
            //     'secretKey' => 'xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx', // 32-character length string
            //     'default_expire' => 3600, // Default expiration time (in seconds)
            // ]);
            $sign = $urlSigner->validate($param);
            if ($sign) {
                // If the signature is valid, proceed with the subsequent logic. If there are encrypted parameters, attempt decryption. If successful, continue processing; if failed, return false
                $path = $urlSigner->decryptParam($param['path']);
                if ($path) {
                    // If the path parameter is successfully decrypted, proceed to download the file
                    return response()->download($path);
                }
            }
            return response();
        }
    }
    ```
2. Generate a download link, where a download link is needed:
    ```php
    $url = 'Link to the download method from the first step';
    $path = 'File path to be downloaded';

    $urlSigner = new UrlSigner();
    // Generate a download link that expires in 60 seconds
    $download_url = $urlSigner->sign($url, [
        'path' => $urlSigner->encrypt($path)
        // If no encryption is required, the encrypt method does not need to be called, and the decryptParam method does not need to be called in the corresponding parameter retrieval method
    ], 60);

    echo $download_url;
    ```
